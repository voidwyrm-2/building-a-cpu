# Building A CPU
This is a project about building a virtual CPU with a custom instruction set based off of a couple of videos from [this playlist by Gary Explains](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLxbi4e2mYGvzNw2RzIsM_rxnNC8m2Kz&si=aTEYycelZVm6tQGz)

He wrote his assembler in Python, but I'm writing it in C# instead because I enjoy C# and it'll be more stable and easier to continue work on than Python

I can't find his video on the virtual CPU part so I'm just winging that part

My CPU is called the Stupidly Made CPU 4-byte or the SMC-4<br>
And my instruction set is called the Badly Made Assembly Instruction Set or BMAIS(buh-maze)
